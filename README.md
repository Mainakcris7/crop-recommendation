# Crop Recommendation ðŸŒ¾

Hey there! So, imagine you're a farmer looking for the best crops to grow in your region. Well, worry no more because I've got just the solution for you! My crop recommendation project takes into account factors like nitrogen levels, humidity, and rainfall to suggest the perfect crops for your soil. And guess what? After crunching all the data, I found that `CatBoost` performed the best with an accuracy score of `0.993`! So whether you're thinking of planting **rice, maize, chickpeas, kidney beans, pigeon peas, or any other crop on our list**, rest assured, we've got you covered. Just sit back, relax, and watch your harvest thrive!
